This project is a simple color detection and tracking application using Python and OpenCV. It allows you to interactively specify a color range and track objects of that color in real-time video from your webcam.

## Features

- Real-time color detection and tracking.
- Interactive adjustment of color range using trackbars.
- Webcam integration for live video input.
- Easy-to-use graphical user interface.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Color Detection From Webcam project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)

You can install OpenCV using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ahmad10Raza/Color_Detection_From_Webcam.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Color_Detection_From_Webcam
   ```
3. Run the Color Detection application:

   ```bash
   python Color_Detection_With_Contours.py
   ```
4. Adjust the color range using the trackbars to detect and track objects of the specified color.
5. Press the 'Esc' key to exit the application.

## Usage

- Launch the application and make sure your webcam is active.
- Use the trackbars to adjust the lower and upper HSV values to specify the color range you want to detect.
- The program will display the original video feed along with a mask showing the detected color range and the resulting color-tracked video.
